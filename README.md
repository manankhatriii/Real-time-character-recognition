# Real-time-character-recognition

I developed a real-time number recognition system using the MNIST 784 dataset. The project involved hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV to optimize the model's performance. I captured video from a real-time webcam and focused on detecting numbers around the center of the window. The system continuously captured images and utilized a trained SVC model to predict the numbers in real-time. This project honed my skills in computer vision, real-time data processing, and machine learning model optimization, demonstrating my ability to apply advanced techniques to practical problems.I developed a real-time number recognition system using the MNIST 784 dataset.
